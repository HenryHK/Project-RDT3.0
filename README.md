## Project of COMP3234, Stop-and-Wait (rdt3.0) ARQ


The final version is OK in an environment with window size = 1 both having or not having packet loss and corruption. In an environment with windows size at [1..9], this program works without packet loss and corruption. But with packet loss and corruption, there may having problem during establishing connection between host and client which leads to a infinite loop.(I guess this is a unfixed bug in skeleton.)


Many thanks to Kaicheng Yu who helps me a lot to understand the window part.
